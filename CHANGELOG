# Changelog

## 1.3.1

* Shorten entitiy names that are too long to fit in a line.

    > Identites such as PESEL, NIP, REGON got overwritten by too long names.

## 1.3.0

* Add blank pages if necessary to make entities fit full sheets of paper.

    > This feature is not available in rear page mode.

## 1.2.0rc1

* Display page number on each page.

## 1.1.1rc1

* Trim leading zeros in identities such as PESEL, NIP, REGON.

    > Some banks send IDs with leading zeros while others don't,
    > which results in treating the same debtor as separate ones.

## 1.1.0rc1

* Add a configuration flag `show_rear` to render rear side (false by default).

## 1.0.0rc4

* Paginate bank replies if they don't fit into a single page.
* Add pagination indicator next to debtor name, e.g. "(1/3)".

## 1.0.0rc3

* Parse and format datetime to fit the cells in the resulting PDF document.

    > This is because some banks started to include timezone and fractional
    > seconds in their XML responses, which made the string very long, e.g.
    > `2016-08-01T12:30:30.8929287+02:00` vs. `2016-08-01`.

* Add a configuration flag `show_time` to enable rendering of full date
  with time component (turned off by default).

## 1.0.0rc2

* Sort person debtors by last name first using UCA collation.
* Use more prominent font size for positive replies.

## 1.0.0rc1

* Initial version.
