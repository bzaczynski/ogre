# Changelog

## 1.0.0rc3

* Parse and format datetime to fit the cells in the resulting PDF document.

    > This is because some banks started to include timezone and fractional
    > seconds in their XML responses, which made the string very long, e.g.
    > `2016-08-01T12:30:30.8929287+02:00` vs. `2016-08-01`.

## 1.0.0rc2

* Sort person debtors by last name first using UCA collation.
* Use more prominent font size for positive replies.

## 1.0.0rc1

* Initial version.
