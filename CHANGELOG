# Changelog

## 1.1.0rc1

* Add a configuration flag `show_rear` to render rear side (false by default).

## 1.0.0rc4

* Paginate bank replies if they don't fit into a single page.
* Add pagination indicator next to debtor name, e.g. "(1/3)".

## 1.0.0rc3

* Parse and format datetime to fit the cells in the resulting PDF document.

    > This is because some banks started to include timezone and fractional
    > seconds in their XML responses, which made the string very long, e.g.
    > `2016-08-01T12:30:30.8929287+02:00` vs. `2016-08-01`.

* Add a configuration flag `show_time` to enable rendering of full date
  with time component (turned off by default).

## 1.0.0rc2

* Sort person debtors by last name first using UCA collation.
* Use more prominent font size for positive replies.

## 1.0.0rc1

* Initial version.
